Create Pipeliner contacts and leads easily from Gmail - extract all the data automatically, see what is added already.

Setting up the addon:
---------------------
1. Turn the addon on, reload Gmail page and open any conversation - the "Pipeliner" button will appear in the command bar above the conversation (see the screenshot) - press it.
 
2. The main widget window will appear - press the "cog" icon in its top right corner. Fill all the fields by the values from Pipeliner administration page (open Pipeliner CRM, go to "Administration -> General" and press "Obtain API Key" in the bottom) and hit "Save".

Using the addon:
----------------
1. Adding a contact: 
  * the widget suggests any participant of the conversation that has authored at least one letter to be added as new contact. The icon to the right indicates whether this person is already in Pipeliner or has to be added there yet.
  * when you add a person, all its contact info is filled automatically from the conversation. You only need to link it to an account (a new one can be created on the fly).
2. Creating a lead:
  * A new lead can be created with "Create" button.
  * A contact is required to create a lead - import one before, if the contact list is empty
 
Processing multiple conversations fast:
---------------------------------------
If you don't explicitly close the widget, it remains open whenever you open a conversation - this helps to process many conversations faster if needed.
  
Further development:
--------------------
Please, write your ideas on the addon further improvement in comments below.
This is the first version, and we are thinking on different further improvements like extending contact import to all the participants of a conversation, or linking the same lead to multiple conversations, and your feedback is very important for us to move further.
